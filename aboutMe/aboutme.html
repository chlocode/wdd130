    <h2>Teidor Chloe Enyonam Alafegha-Quakumey</h2>
    <h3 class = hi>Hi everyone!</h3>
    <p class = name>The name's Teidor, pronounced teh(as in Ted)-ee-door. I'm Ghanaian(and part Nigerian).</p>
    <p class = middle>I'm 20 years old and I don't have a particular career in mind to pursue? More like, I'm not sure yet. I graduated last year with a diploma in Biomedical Equipment Technology
        and now, I'm into software development. So far, python seems to be my favorite language to code in because it makes me feel smart... unlike C.
        I hope to learn a lot more programming languages than I do now as well as human languages. I started learning Gaelic (blame Norse mythology), Greek (still mythology) and Korean a while back and I can confidently say I'm quite terrible at all of themü•≤.
        My favorite thing to do is nothing...I mean, practicing for when I retire. Y'know, just getting a headstart so I'd be a pro when the time comesüòÅ.
        If I'm not debugging an error filled code of mine, I'm bingeing k-drama series or shonen, or creating disastrous recipes. For the more productive hobbies of mine, there's random photography, labelling my scrawls as digital art, and admiring the Chevy Camaro and Kawasaki Ninja(for motivation).
        Looking at automechanics as the next adventure.
        I'm working towards a degree in Applied Tech at BYUI. I hope to be really good at the front-end aspect of being a dev. I'm actually aiming for full stack.
        My favorite quote is:

    <p>Nice to meet you!ü§ó</p>
